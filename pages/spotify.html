      Spotify is an exceptional platform that connects people with the music they love and gives artists tools to connect with their fans. This is my take on how to redesign the existing "pre-save" mechanism made possible by third parties as a native Spotify feature.

      In the suggested revision, artists would be able to indicate whether they wanted to make a countdown public in Spotify for Artists. Their next release would then display prominently on their artist page with a countdown to release. This would be associated with a pre-release album or single page that would give users the option to choose to be notified when the release drops, add the track/album to their library, and share it.

    Artists would have the option to choose when to start displaying the countdown timer and what else to share. This also creates the opportunity for artists to include premium pre-release packages that fans could subscribe to featuring full track lists and visuals.
